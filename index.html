// Bouncin' dogs sketch
// ART 4990 Workshop 2 / p5js x github website builder
// Code sources used in this sketch: Aubrey Pohl, Daniel Shiffman, Sophia Timmons.
// In this sketch, you will learn how to add images to a canvas, text, and how to animate without frameCount.
// The full Workshop 2 demo includes how to publish your sketch (or anything) as a website via Github
// AP will publish a full recorded demo at a later date.

// Declare x and y variables to be used later to track the position and dimension of images.
let x;
let y;

// Declare variables for the speed of a moving x and y value.
let xspeed;
let yspeed;

// Build an empty array called 'img' to be filled with images later.
let img = [];

// Declare variable that will be used to cycle through an index of images.
// In code, everything starts at 0, so 0 becomes #1. For example. In this list '0,1,2', 0 is the first interger, so the list has 3 items.
let index = 0;

// This function lets us load files. Images, data, 3D files, etc.
function preload() {
// Here we are loading images from outside of the sketch.
// The images are being added to the empty 'img[]' starting at 0 (first image in the array).
	img[0] = loadImage('https://i.imgur.com/nHVVLLe.png');
	img[1] = loadImage('https://i.imgur.com/IvB1sfF.png');
	img[2] = loadImage('https://i.imgur.com/kKPSkrZ.png');

}

// Set up is where we initate all the foundational pieces of our sketch. Canvas size, image modes, text alignment, etc.
function setup() {
	createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight); //canvas size.
	x = random(width); //random width for start of x.
	y = random(height); //random height for start of y.
	xspeed = 3; //declaring speed of x.
	yspeed = 3; //declaring speed of y.

// LOOP! Sophia found a solution for the broken code. Ask her where!
// We will cover loops in the future, but they are a great way to make your code efficient.
// Here the loop is applying an image resize function to all of the images in our 'img[]' array.
// the 'img.length' is not speaking to the length of an image, but the length of the array.
	for(i = 0; i < img.length; i++) {
		img[i].resize(300, 0);
	}

// Initiating text formatting, fill color for text and objects, stroke or no stroke, etc.
	textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
	textSize(width / 10);
	fill(100,34,68);
	// noFill();
	// stroke(255);


}

// Setup runs once to initiate the sketch, draw keeps looping to keep things updated, moving, changing.
function draw() {
	background(7,50,50); //background value of 0 (black), and an opacity value of 3 (out of 255).

	text('Cats', width / 2, height / 2); //putting text on the canvas.

	image(img[index], x, y); //placing our image on the canvas. Index grabs an image from our 'img[]' array.

	x = x + xspeed; //x = whatever x is at the start, + whatever we told xspeed to be, constantly updated in draw.
	y = y + yspeed; //y = whatever y is at the start, + whatever we told yspeed to be, constantly updated in draw.

// Here we are creating the 'dvd bounce' effect. 
// If Statements are how we add conditions to our sketch. If this happens, then this happens, etc.
// We are setting the parameters of our moving objects so that they stay within the bounds of the sketch.
// Plugging 'index' in to our if statements allow us to cycle through images in our array.
// We will cover If Statements in detail at a later date.
// The '%' used in the 'index = (index + 1) % img.length' helps us cycle back to the beginning of our array.
